# I'm MissinginAction.
Working on modded projects for EFT with a team of people and a couple websites.
Self-taught video editing, game development, some foley, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Not a professional nor "good" SPT/Unity modder. Still learning. Don't ask for things from me and expect a good result.
